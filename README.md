**Ask**

Five questions will guide your case study:
1. What type of company does your client represent, and what are they asking you to accomplish?
2. What are the key factors involved in the business task you are investigating?
3. What type of data will be appropriate for your analysis?
4. Where will you obtain that data?
5. Who is your audience, and what materials will help you present to them?

You will produce a report with the following deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task you have selected to investigate
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Based on what you discover, a list of additional deliverables you think would be helpful to include for further exploration
7. Your top high-level insights based on your analysis
